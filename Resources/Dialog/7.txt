Superb! 
You showed these Gladiators how it is done.
You might realize now that there is more to combat than bumping into folks.
This is a battle of speed, momentum and - you guessed it, spin.
The higher your velocity and spin the higher your damage. When you are above a certain threshold enemies won't be able to damage you at all.
Makes sense right? 
We can't just take any spinning person, we need the... Spinniest.
Not to talk down on your success, but those folks were small flies in the competetive spinning community.
Let's see how you handle the REAL real deal.
