Yikes! That ruffian just bumped into you. 
You didn't have enough momentum or spin, which is why you were the one harmed.
Well, maybe it was my fault for keeping you here on this spot.
Sorry, I was just admiring your looping around...
But we can't let that stand.
Show that baffoon your moves!
Use your dash to generate momentum and dash into him or just build up momentum and spin by skating around.
